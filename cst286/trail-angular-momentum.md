<!-- Editable text for trail-angular-momentum.html (not built yet). DRAFT 1, 29 Oct 2026, for Prof. Sathya's edit. Nothing is linked from Canvas or the home page.
Notes for the editor, not shown to students:
- Path A trail for CST286 Sprint 3 (decided 29 Oct): conservation of angular momentum, with the phone as the measuring instrument (phyphox, "Gyroscope (rotation rate)"). Same six-stop shape as trail-accelerometer.md, with practice problems at every stop (his request, 29 Oct) and answers behind a click-to-open.
- Physics note behind stop 6: a phone's gyroscope chip senses rotation through the Coriolis effect on a tiny vibrating mass, not through conservation of angular momentum. The trail says so plainly and points to spinning-wheel gyroscopes (his "Principles of Gyroscopes" video) as the place where angular momentum does the work.
- All numbers were computed, not estimated: record 3.49 rad/s · washer 125.7 rad/s · bottles 1.69 and 0.12 kg·m² · chair 3.0 → 5.2 rad/s with a 2.0 kg·m² body · merry-go-round 1.2 → 1.63 rad/s · skater 2.0 → 5.6 rev/s · diver 1.5 → 5.1 rad/s, about one somersault in 1.2 s · body estimate from data 2.23 kg·m², third test 4.1 rad/s · Earth 0.0000729 rad/s. The 2.0 kg·m² for a seated person plus chair is a rough estimate; stop 5 teaches students to measure their own.
- [SIM spin-two-masses] and [SIM spin-where-it-breaks] are cst286/sims/*.py, run by glowscript/sim.html?sim=<name> like the accelerometer trail's sims (built 29 Oct by an Opus agent from Alan's spec).
- Clip times come from content-tracks/cst286/angular-momentum-digest.md (captions, approximate; check each by watching): fan 3:14-7:00 · linear vs angular 2:34-9:10 (stops before 9:16, where the video says r is the distance to where the force is applied) · conservation problem 1:59-7:38 · gyroscopes 2:20-7:10. Two spoken slips are corrected on the page: the fan's slowing rate said as rad/s (it is rad/s²), and "no external force" in the gyroscope video (it means no outside torque).
- Left out of More practice: Rusty nut (it says rust increases the nut's moment of inertia; rust adds friction) and the Khan momentum video (linear only, and calls the unit of impulse the joule).
- 29 Oct, Prof. Sathya's edit: goal broadened so Path A students have room to explore other scenarios later (his note); "in the right units"; useful line adds the spinning top / wheel. Alan's wording keeps the top as "the first step toward" understanding it, because staying upright is precession under gravity's torque, which this trail's relationship does not predict. Radian detour added at stop 1 (his request): jar-and-string, why radians, his Ladybug video (no new video: Prof. Sathya, 29 Oct, "lets not rely on me producing anything yet"), practice. Pre-edit copy: trail-angular-momentum.md.bak-his-edit-2026-10-29.
- For Item 3 (Five real-world scenarios): the skater, diver, merry-go-round, satellite and Earth examples here are practice; Path A students should bring scenarios of their own to Item 3. Decide whether to say so on Item 3's page. -->

CST286 · Fall 2026 · Sprint 3 · Path A · A trail you can take as your Sprint 3 goal

# How fast will you spin?

Sit on a spinning chair, hold your arms out, and push off. Now pull your arms in. You speed up, and nobody pushed you. Figure skaters, divers and satellites use the same physics to control their spin, and the phone in your pocket can measure it. On this trail you learn the relationship, predict your own spin, and use your phone to check whether you were right.

## A goal you can take as written
Goal: Understand how spinning objects behave differently from objects moving in a straight line, and use that to predict how a spin changes.

A quantitative relationship I will be able to use:
> **Given** how fast something is spinning, and how its mass is arranged around the axis before and after the arrangement changes, in the right units,
> **I can predict** how fast it will spin afterwards, in the right units.
> **This is useful because** the same relationship explains how skaters, divers and satellites control their spin, and it is the first step toward understanding why a spinning top or a bicycle wheel stays upright.

**Copy this goal** - paste it into your Sprint 3 goal as it is, or change it at stop 6.

The trail has six stops. Stops 1 and 2 teach you to read and record a spin rate. Stops 3 and 4 are the two ideas the prediction depends on. At stop 5 you predict your own spin and test it, and stop 6 shows where the relationship stops working. Every stop ends with practice problems; try each one before you open its answer.

**What you need:** a chair that spins freely, two equal weights you can hold in each hand (full 1.5-liter water bottles work well), a tape measure, a phone, and a friend to spot you. Install the free app **phyphox** (iPhone and Android). If your phone has no gyroscope, phyphox will say so; pair up with someone whose phone does.

## Stop 1 · Spin rate

**Why this stop.** Your phone does not report "fast" or "slow". It reports a number in radians per second. Before you can use that number, you need to know what a radian is and how to turn radians per second into turns per second or turns per minute.

**After this stop you can** convert a spin rate between radians per second, revolutions per second and revolutions per minute, and say what the sign of a gyroscope reading means.

**Watch.** Prof. Sathya works the switched-off fan problem - 4 min clip [CLIP dbOR0ccwQFs 194 420]. When the clip says the fan slows by 1 rad/s, it means 1 rad/s every second, which is written rad/s².

**Worked example.** A ceiling fan turns at 120 revolutions per minute. What is its spin rate in radians per second?

*Predict first:* is the answer closer to 2, 12 or 120?

1. One full turn is 2π radians, which is about 6.28 radians.
2. Write where you start and where you want to end: 120 rev/min → rad/s.
3. Line up the conversion factors so the units you do not want cancel: 120 rev/min × 2π rad/1 rev × 1 min/60 s.
4. Revolutions cancel, then minutes, and radians per second are left.
5. 120 × 6.28 ÷ 60 = **12.6 rad/s**, which is 2 turns every second.

**Units check.** A radian is not a degree. One turn is 360 degrees and also 2π radians, so a reading of 6.28 means one turn per second only if the unit is radians per second. If an app reports degrees per second, the same spin shows as 360.

**Detour · What is a radian?** (click to open) Take this detour if "radian" is new to you, or if the worked example above felt like following steps you could not explain.
- *Try it with a jar and a string (10 minutes).* Cut a piece of string as long as the radius of a round jar or plate, from the center to the edge. Lay the string along the edge and mark where it ends. The angle between the two ends, seen from the center, is one radian. Keep stepping the string around the edge: a little more than six lengths fit, about 6.28, which is 2π. A bigger jar needs a longer string, but the same 6.28 lengths fit, so one full turn is 2π radians for any circle.
- *Why physics uses radians.* A radian ties an angle to a distance: the distance along the edge equals the radius times the angle in radians. So a point 0.5 m from the axis, turning at 2 rad/s, travels 1 m every second. Degrees do not give you that shortcut.
- *Watch.* Ladybug on a turntable - Prof. Sathya · [youtu.be/2-032DBce-o](https://youtu.be/2-032DBce-o): two ladybugs turn at the same rate in radians per second, and the one farther out moves faster.
- *Practice.*
  1. How many radians is a quarter turn? *Answer:* 2π ÷ 4 = 1.57 rad.
  2. How many degrees is one radian? *Answer:* 360 ÷ 6.28 = 57.3 degrees.
  3. The tip of a ceiling fan blade is 0.6 m from the center, and the fan turns at 12.6 rad/s. How fast does the tip move? *Answer:* 0.6 × 12.6 = 7.6 m/s.
  4. Two ladybugs sit on a record turning at 3.49 rad/s, one 0.10 m from the center and one 0.15 m out. How fast does each move? *Answer:* 0.35 m/s and 0.52 m/s; same spin rate, different speeds.
- *Ask your Dojo.* "I will tell you what I think a radian is. Ask me to show it with a string and a jar, and stop me where my explanation would not work for a bigger jar."
- *If lining up conversion factors is the hard part,* work through stop 1 (Units) of the accelerometer trail first, then come back.

**Reading the sign.** Lay your phone flat, screen up. The gyroscope's z reading is the spin about the line straight up out of the screen. A positive z means the phone turns counterclockwise as you look down at the screen; a negative z means clockwise.

**Try it.** Open phyphox and choose "Gyroscope (rotation rate)". Lay the phone flat on a table and leave it still for 20 seconds. Write down the largest number you see on z. Your phone is not turning, so this number is noise: a spin smaller than this is lost in it.

**Practice.**
1. A record player turns at 33⅓ revolutions per minute. What is that in radians per second?
   *Answer (click to open):* 33.33 × 2π ÷ 60 = 3.49 rad/s.
2. On the spin cycle a washing machine drum turns at 1,200 revolutions per minute. How many turns does it make each second, and what is its spin rate in radians per second?
   *Answer:* 20 turns per second; 1,200 × 2π ÷ 60 = 126 rad/s.
3. You spin on a chair with your phone flat against your chest, screen up, and phyphox shows z = −6.3 rad/s. How many turns per second are you making, and which way?
   *Answer:* 6.3 ÷ 6.28 ≈ 1 turn per second, clockwise as seen from above, because the reading is negative.
4. The Earth turns once in about 86,164 seconds. What is its spin rate in radians per second? Compare it with the number you wrote down in "Try it". Could your phone feel the Earth turning?
   *Answer:* 2π ÷ 86,164 = 0.0000729 rad/s. Compare it with your own still-phone reading; if your reading is larger, the Earth's turn is lost in it.

**Ask your Dojo.**
- "Give me a spin rate in revolutions per minute from everyday life. Do not solve it. Ask me to set up the conversion to radians per second, and tell me only whether my units cancel."
- "Ask me why one turn is 2π radians, and keep asking until I explain it using the distance around a circle."

## Stop 2 · Record your own spin

**Why this stop.** The rest of the trail predicts a number you will measure here, so measure it first and keep the graph. Seeing your own spin speed up is what makes the prediction worth checking.

**After this stop you can** record your spin rate with arms out and arms in, and read both numbers from a phyphox graph.

**Set up.** Measure the distance from the chair's axis (the post under the seat) to the center of each bottle when your arms are straight out, and again when you hold the bottles against your chest. Write both distances in meters.

**Record.**
1. Sit on the chair, feet off the floor. Hold the phone flat against your chest, screen up, and press record in phyphox ("Gyroscope (rotation rate)"). In phyphox you can also turn on "Remote access" and watch the graph live in a laptop browser.
2. Hold the bottles straight out. Your friend gives the chair a gentle turn and steps back.
3. After two full turns, pull the bottles in to your chest and hold them there for two more turns.
4. Put a foot down, stop, and stop the recording.

*Predict first:* before you record, write down how many times faster you expect to spin with the bottles in.

**Read the graph.** The z line has a lower flat part (arms out) and a higher flat part (arms in). Write down the z value in the middle of each flat part. These are your ω₁ and ω₂ (ω, the Greek letter omega, is the usual symbol for spin rate).

**Safety.** Keep the spin gentle, keep your feet ready, and stop if you feel dizzy. Your friend spots you.

**Practice.**
1. A student records z = 2.8 rad/s with arms out and z = 4.6 rad/s with arms in. How many times faster did she spin with her arms in?
   *Answer:* 4.6 ÷ 2.8 = 1.6 times faster.
2. In the same recording, the arms-out part of the graph slopes slowly down instead of staying flat. Name one thing that could be slowing the chair.
   *Answer:* friction in the chair's bearing, air on the outstretched arms, or a foot brushing the floor. Each one twists against the spin from outside.

**Ask your Dojo.**
- "I will describe my phyphox graph. Ask me questions until we agree on which parts are arms out, arms in, and the moments in between."

## Stop 3 · Moment of inertia

**Why this stop.** Pulling the bottles in did not change their mass, so something else about them changed. What changed is how far the mass sits from the axis, and the moment of inertia is the quantity that measures that.

**After this stop you can** calculate the moment of inertia of masses held at a distance from an axis, and explain why distance matters more than mass.

**Watch.** Linear vs angular motion - Prof. Sathya, 7 min clip [CLIP mVFrEitAnRs 154 550]

**Worked example.** You hold two 1.5 kg water bottles 0.75 m from the chair's axis, then pull them in to 0.20 m. By how much does the bottles' moment of inertia change?

*Predict first:* the distance shrinks to about a quarter. Does the moment of inertia shrink to a quarter, less than a quarter, or more?

1. For a small mass at a distance r from the axis, the moment of inertia is I = m r².
2. With two bottles, add them: I = 2 × m × r².
3. Arms out: I = 2 × 1.5 kg × (0.75 m)² = **1.69 kg·m²**.
4. Arms in: I = 2 × 1.5 kg × (0.20 m)² = **0.12 kg·m²**.
5. The distance shrank to about a quarter, but because it is squared, the moment of inertia shrank to about one fourteenth.

**Units check.** Put the distances in centimeters and the arms-out answer becomes 2 × 1.5 × 75² = 16,875. The number looks dramatic, but its unit is kg·cm², and every later step expects kg·m². Convert distances to meters first.

**Practice.**
1. Which is harder to start spinning: 1 kg held 2 m from the axis, or 4 kg held 1 m from the axis?
   *Answer:* neither. 1 × 2² = 4 kg·m² and 4 × 1² = 4 kg·m². Doubling the distance counts as much as four times the mass.
2. Two 25 kg children sit on the edge of a playground merry-go-round, 1.5 m from the center. What do they add to its moment of inertia?
   *Answer:* 2 × 25 × 1.5² = 112.5 kg·m².
3. A figure skater's two arms are about 3.5 kg each. Treat each arm as a mass at its middle: 0.35 m from the axis when the arms are out, 0.10 m when they are folded in. What do the arms contribute in each position?
   *Answer:* out: 2 × 3.5 × 0.35² = 0.86 kg·m²; in: 2 × 3.5 × 0.10² = 0.07 kg·m².

**Ask your Dojo.**
- "Ask me why a door is harder to open when I push near the hinge, and then ask me how that connects to holding weights far from the axis."
- "Give me two objects with different masses and distances. Ask me to predict which has the larger moment of inertia before I calculate."

## Stop 4 · Angular momentum stays the same

**Why this stop.** This is the relationship in the goal. Spin rate and moment of inertia trade against each other, and the trade is exact as long as nothing outside the spinning system twists it.

**After this stop you can** use I₁ω₁ = I₂ω₂ to predict a new spin rate, and say what condition must hold for the prediction to work.

**Watch.** Prof. Sathya works a conservation of angular momentum problem - 6 min clip [CLIP orAtL67eKc8 119 458]. A mass pulled in to half its distance from the axis spins four times as fast: that is I₁ω₁ = I₂ω₂ with I₂ a quarter of I₁.

**The idea.** Angular momentum is the moment of inertia times the spin rate: L = Iω. When nothing outside the system twists it (no outside torque), L stays the same. So if I gets smaller, ω has to get larger by the same factor: I₁ω₁ = I₂ω₂, and ω₂ = ω₁ × I₁ ÷ I₂.

**Worked example.** A playground merry-go-round has a moment of inertia of 150 kg·m² on its own. It spins at 1.2 rad/s with one 25 kg child sitting at the edge, 1.5 m from the center. The child walks in to 0.3 m from the center. How fast does it spin now?

*Predict first:* faster or slower, and by a little or by a lot?

1. Before: I₁ = 150 + 25 × 1.5² = 206.25 kg·m².
2. After: I₂ = 150 + 25 × 0.3² = 152.25 kg·m².
3. Nobody pushes the merry-go-round and we ignore the friction in its bearing, so angular momentum stays the same: ω₂ = ω₁ × I₁ ÷ I₂.
4. ω₂ = 1.2 rad/s × 206.25 ÷ 152.25 = **1.63 rad/s**.
5. The child is only a small part of the total moment of inertia, so the speed-up is modest, about a third.

**Units check.** I₁ ÷ I₂ has no unit, because kg·m² divided by kg·m² cancels. So ω₂ comes out in whatever unit ω₁ was in. Put ω₁ in revolutions per second and ω₂ is in revolutions per second; you only have to be consistent.

**Try it.** [SIM spin-two-masses] The starter code spins a chair with two weights held out, then slides the weights in after two seconds. Before you run it, use I₁ω₁ = I₂ω₂ to predict the spin rate after the pull, and write it down. Run the code and compare. Then move r_end all the way to 0, predict again, and run it. Watch the L graph each time: the line stays flat because nothing outside twists the chair.

**Practice.**
1. A figure skater spins at 2.0 revolutions per second with her arms out, when her moment of inertia is 2.8 kg·m². She pulls in to 1.0 kg·m². How fast does she spin?
   *Answer:* 2.0 × 2.8 ÷ 1.0 = 5.6 revolutions per second.
2. A diver leaves the board turning at 1.5 rad/s with a moment of inertia of 12 kg·m² in the straight position, then tucks to 3.5 kg·m². How fast does he turn in the tuck, and about how many somersaults does he complete in 1.2 s of tuck?
   *Answer:* 1.5 × 12 ÷ 3.5 = 5.1 rad/s; 5.1 × 1.2 ÷ 6.28 ≈ 1 somersault.
3. A satellite in space turns slowly at 0.02 rad/s with its solar panels folded. It unfolds them, and its moment of inertia triples. What happens to its spin?
   *Answer:* it slows to a third, 0.0067 rad/s. In space nothing outside twists it, so the trade is exact.

**Ask your Dojo.**
- "Ask me to explain why a skater speeds up using L = Iω, and keep asking 'what twists her?' until I say nothing outside does."
- "Give me a spinning situation and ask me whether angular momentum stays the same. Make me name the outside twist if there is one."

## Stop 5 · Predict your own spin, then test it

**Why this stop.** Now you put the pieces together for yourself. To predict your spin you need your whole moment of inertia, and the bottles are only part of it: your body and the chair count too. You cannot weigh your body's moment of inertia directly, so this stop shows you how to estimate it from your own data and then test a new prediction.

**After this stop you can** predict your spin rate after pulling the weights in, measure it, and use the difference to improve the next prediction.

**Worked example, part 1 - predict.** A seated person and the chair together have a moment of inertia of about 2.0 kg·m² (a rough estimate). Add the bottles from stop 3. The person spins at 3.0 rad/s with the bottles out. Predict the spin rate with the bottles in.

1. Arms out: I₁ = 2.0 + 1.69 = 3.69 kg·m².
2. Arms in: I₂ = 2.0 + 0.12 = 2.12 kg·m².
3. ω₂ = 3.0 × 3.69 ÷ 2.12 = **5.2 rad/s**.

**Worked example, part 2 - learn from the measurement.** Suppose the phone reads 5.0 rad/s, not 5.2. Treat your body's moment of inertia, B, as the unknown and let the data tell you what it is.

1. Angular momentum stays the same: (B + 1.69) × 3.0 = (B + 0.12) × 5.0.
2. Multiply out: 3.0B + 5.06 = 5.0B + 0.60.
3. Solve: 2.0B = 4.46, so B = **2.23 kg·m²**.
4. Use it to predict something new. Hold the bottles at 0.45 m instead of pulling them all the way in: I = 2 × 1.5 × 0.45² = 0.61 kg·m², so ω = 3.0 × (2.23 + 1.69) ÷ (2.23 + 0.61) = **4.1 rad/s**.
5. Record that third spin and compare. If the prediction from your own B is closer than the one from the rough 2.0, the measurement taught your model something.

**Your turn.**
1. Measure your two distances (stop 2) and calculate the bottles' moment of inertia in each position (stop 3).
2. Start with B = 2.0 kg·m² and predict ω₂ from your measured ω₁.
3. Compare with your measured ω₂. Then solve for your own B, as in part 2.
4. Predict a third position with your B, record it, and compare.

**Practice.**
1. A student with arms out spins at 2.5 rad/s and, with arms in, at 4.0 rad/s. Her bottles contribute 1.69 kg·m² out and 0.12 kg·m² in. What is B for her and the chair?
   *Answer:* (B + 1.69) × 2.5 = (B + 0.12) × 4.0 → 2.5B + 4.23 = 4.0B + 0.48 → B = 2.5 kg·m².
2. If the chair's bearing has noticeable friction, will the B you calculate come out too large or too small? Explain using what friction does to ω₂.
   *Answer:* friction lowers the measured ω₂, and a lower ω₂ makes the equation return a larger B. So B comes out too large; it then includes the chair's friction, which is not part of your body.

**Ask your Dojo.**
- "I will give you my measured ω₁, ω₂ and my two distances. Do not calculate for me. Ask me to set up the equation for B and check only whether each step keeps the units consistent."

## Stop 6 · Where it stops working, and how your phone senses a turn

**Why this stop.** The relationship ω₂ = ω₁ × I₁ ÷ I₂ holds only while nothing outside the system twists it. Some situations look the same and break that condition, and one looks like it should work and gives the wrong answer for a different reason.

**After this stop you can** tell apart situations where I₁ω₁ = I₂ω₂ predicts correctly from ones that only look similar, and say why.

**Practice - does the relationship apply?** Decide before you open each answer.
1. While spinning with the bottles in, you let one foot drag on the floor.
   *Answer:* no. The floor twists you from outside, so angular momentum falls and you slow down; I₁ω₁ = I₂ω₂ cannot predict how much.
2. While spinning with your arms out, you let go of both bottles. Do you speed up?
   *Answer:* no, and this is the trap. The bottles fly off carrying their own share of the angular momentum. Your own moment of inertia and spin rate stay the same at the moment you let go. The relationship still holds for the whole system, but you cannot apply it to yourself alone.
3. A friend pushes the chair's back while you spin.
   *Answer:* no. The push is an outside twist.
4. If ice sheets melt and the water spreads toward the equator, does the length of a day change?
   *Answer:* yes, slightly longer. Mass moves farther from Earth's axis, so I grows and ω falls. Nothing outside twists the Earth enough to matter here, so the relationship applies.

**Try it.** [SIM spin-where-it-breaks] This is the chair from stop 4 with two switches. First set friction_torque to 0.5 and predict whether the L line will stay flat; run it and compare. Then set friction_torque back to 0 and let_go to True: the weights are released instead of pulled in. Predict the chair's spin rate after the release before you run it. The second line on the L graph shows the chair's own share of the angular momentum, so you can see where the rest went.

**How your phone senses the turn.** Your phone measured all of this, but it does not do it with angular momentum. Inside the chip a tiny mass vibrates back and forth very fast. When the phone turns, the turning pushes the vibrating mass slightly sideways (this is called the Coriolis effect), and the chip measures that sideways push. The faster the turn, the larger the push. Older gyroscopes, like the spinning wheels in aircraft instruments, do use angular momentum: a fast-spinning wheel keeps pointing the same way while the aircraft turns around it.

**Watch.** Principles of gyroscopes - Prof. Sathya, 5 min clip [CLIP kbg7UE3qwqs 140 430]. Where the clip says "no external force", read it as no outside twist (no outside torque).

**Ask your Dojo.**
- "Give me three spinning situations one at a time. For each, ask me whether something outside twists the system, and only then ask whether I₁ω₁ = I₂ω₂ applies."
- "Ask me to explain the difference between how my phone's gyroscope senses a turn and how a spinning-wheel gyroscope works."

## Where this page comes from

The videos and clips by Prof. Sathya come from earlier offerings of CST286. phyphox is a free app from RWTH Aachen University. The trail layout, the worked examples, the practice problems, the units checks and the two simulations were drafted with AI and reviewed by Prof. Sathya.
