        "Being better than AI at everything",

      "hint": "Think about what 'super' adds to 'agency' — it's about expanding what YOU can do.",
      "explanation": "Superagency isn't about replacing your thinking with AI — it's about amplifying your capabilities. You become able to attempt problems that would have been out of reach before."

      "hint": "What can you bring to the partnership that AI cannot?",
      "explanation": "You bring the 'why' — the understanding of context, stakeholders, and what actually matters. AI brings capability, but you bring judgment about how to use it."
