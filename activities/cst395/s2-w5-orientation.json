      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "prompt": "Sprint 2 is called 'Mirror.' In Sprint 1, you were both the designer and the stakeholder — you had complete knowledge of your own problem. What is the fundamental change in Sprint 2?",
      "options": [
        "You work on a harder version of the same problem",
        "You work with a partner — solving their problem, not yours",
        "You switch from coding to design only",
        "You work alone but on a problem assigned by the instructor"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "hint": "Think about who the 'stakeholder' is in Sprint 2 — whose problem are you solving?",
      "explanation": "In Sprint 2, you'll be paired with a classmate. You'll solve their problem and they'll help you understand yours from a new perspective. The hardest part isn't building — it's truly understanding someone else's problem."

      "id": "q2-why-mirror",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "prompt": "Why is this sprint called 'Mirror'?",
      "options": [
        "You copy your partner's work",
        "You make your thinking visible to your partner — what was internal becomes external",
        "You reflect on Sprint 1 for the entire sprint",
        "Your partner builds an identical version of your project"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "hint": "The sprint concept is 'Interface' — what stays internal vs. what becomes visible.",
      "explanation": "In Sprint 1, your design thinking was internal — only you needed to understand it. In Sprint 2, you need to make your thinking visible to someone else through documentation, rationale, and communication. Your partner is your mirror, reflecting back whether you truly understand their problem."

        "Goals and Demo",

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "hint": "Goals (20%) and Demo (40%) are individual. What about the other 40%?",
      "explanation": "Goals (20%) and Demo (40%) are individual. Reflections (20%) and Check-ins (20%) are group-averaged — your partner's participation matters. This creates mutual accountability: you need each other to succeed."

      "id": "q4-two-part-goals",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "prompt": "Goal Setting in Sprint 2 has two parts. Why is it split into Part I (before meeting your partner) and Part II (after meeting them)?",
      "options": [
        "To give you more time to finish",
        "Part I prepares you for the conversation; Part II sets real goals based on what you actually learned about your partner's problem",

      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "hint": "You can't set specific goals for solving someone's problem if you haven't met them yet.",
      "explanation": "Part I (due Feb 16) helps you prepare — reflecting on problem-solving skills and drafting interview questions. Part II (due Feb 20) happens after you meet your partner in class on Wednesday — now you can set specific goals based on their actual problem, not assumptions."

      "hint": "Think about who evaluates your work and what 'value' means when solving someone else's problem.",
      "explanation": "The Human Value Statement asks: what did YOU contribute that AI couldn't? Your partner — the person whose problem you solved — evaluates whether you truly understood their needs. This is the ultimate test of whether you made your thinking visible and genuinely helpful."
