You had complete knowledge of your own problem — no interviews needed, no guessing about requirements.</p><p>Sprint 2 changes that fundamentally. You'll be paired with a classmate and <strong>you'll solve their problem, not yours</strong>. They become your stakeholder. You'll have incomplete knowledge and will need to communicate, listen, and adapt your design based on what you learn about their needs.</p><p>Your partner will also be working on understanding your problem — it goes both ways.</p>",

You knew your own friction, your own constraints, your own motivation.</p><p>In Sprint 2, you need to make all of that <strong>visible to someone else</strong>. Your documentation, your rationale, your communication — these become the interface through which your partner understands the problem.</p><p>Your partner is your mirror: they reflect back whether your thinking is actually clear or just clear to you. If they can't understand your problem from your description, the design will fail — no matter how good the code is.</p>",

Now that you know their actual problem, set specific goals for solving it.</li></ul><p>This split exists because <strong>you can't set meaningful goals for solving someone's problem before you've met them</strong>.
