Your team-designed demonstration, judged by your partner.</li></ul><p>This means <strong>40% of your grade depends on mutual engagement</strong>. You need each other to succeed.</p><p>Notice how the grading structure maps to the sprint outcome: the group-averaged components (40%) build your deep understanding of your partner, and the Demo (40%) is where you prove that understanding produced something they couldn't have asked for themselves.</p>",
