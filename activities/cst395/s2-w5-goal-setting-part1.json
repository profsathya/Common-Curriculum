      "aiContext": "This is Sprint 2 goal setting in CST395 (AI-Native Development). In Sprint 1, students worked on their own problem using 5 Whys analysis, connection formula, design decision analysis, and solution architecture. Sprint 2 pairs them with a partner whose problem they'll help solve — the key shift is from self-as-stakeholder to another-person-as-stakeholder. This question asks them to reflect on what problem-understanding methods actually worked. Look for honest assessment, not just listing tools — did they actually find root causes? Were their assumptions wrong? What would they do differently?",

      "minLength": 80,
      "numQuestions": 3,
      "aiContext": "This is Sprint 2 goal setting in CST395. The key theme is: 'The hardest part isn't building — it's truly understanding the problem from another person's point of view.' In Sprint 1, students designed for themselves. In Sprint 2, they must understand a partner's problem deeply enough to design a solution. This question probes their awareness of the empathy gap. Look for: recognition that their assumptions will likely be wrong, awareness that 'obvious' solutions may miss the real need, and honesty about communication challenges.",

      "aiContext": "This is Sprint 2 goal setting in CST395. Students are preparing 'customer interview' questions for when they meet their assigned partner next week in class. Good questions go beyond 'what do you want?' to understand the real need, the context, the constraints, and the human values involved. Look for: open-ended questions (not yes/no), questions that uncover assumptions and hidden needs, questions about context and constraints (not just features), and questions that show genuine curiosity about the person's experience. Challenge surface-level questions like 'what's your problem?' — push for depth.",

      "aiContext": "This is Sprint 2 goal setting in CST395. This question asks for a personal growth goal alongside the project goal. Sprint 2 is about the shift from self to others — from being your own stakeholder to understanding someone else's perspective. Students should think about what they want to learn about empathy, communication, stakeholder understanding, and human-centered design. Look for goals that go beyond technical output, that show self-awareness about growth areas, and that connect to what Sprint 1 revealed about their blind spots.",
