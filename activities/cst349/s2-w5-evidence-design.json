  "description": "Your Sprint 2 demo uses a 5-slide format to tell a growth story. Before collecting evidence, you need to design what that evidence will look like — and AI feedback will help you go deeper than your first instinct.\n\nThe 5 slides: (1) The quality & why it matters, (2) Your starting point, (3) What you did, (4) Evidence of growth, (5) Your trajectory / what's next.\n\nFor each question below, enter your initial response, then use the AI-generated questions to push your thinking further. Strong evidence = before/after comparisons, external feedback, specific examples with dates, measurable change. Weak evidence = \"I feel like I improved,\" effort without results, vague claims, only self-assessment.",

The student is planning how to capture their starting point (baseline) for a professional skill they're developing. They need to document a clear 'before' state so they can show growth later in a 5-slide demo. Push them on: Is the baseline measurable or just a feeling? Would a stranger be able to understand where they started? Is this something their group partners could verify? Could they be more specific about format, timing, or what exactly they'll capture?",

Common pitfalls: choosing evidence that's easy to fake, relying on a single data point, not accounting for external factors, setting the bar too low (guaranteed 'growth') or too high (impossible to show progress). Push them on: Are you being honest about what might fail? What if your baseline was wrong? What if you do the work but growth is hard to measure? Is your backup plan just a weaker version of the same thing, or a genuinely different approach?",
