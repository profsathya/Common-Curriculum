      "prompt": "Sprint 2 is called 'Accountable Growth.' In Sprint 1, you developed a skill on your own — the only accountability was yourself. What is the biggest change in Sprint 2?",
      "options": [
        "You pick a completely new skill to develop from scratch",
        "You work in a group where collaborative accountability shapes your growth",

      "hint": "Think about what 'accountable' means — who are you accountable to in Sprint 2?",
      "explanation": "Sprint 2 puts you in a group. Your group partners' effort affects part of your grade (reflections and check-ins are group-averaged), and you'll need to give and receive honest feedback. The skill you're developing continues from Sprint 1, but now with external accountability."

      "hint": "Goals (20%) and Demo (40%) are individual. What about the other 40%?",
      "explanation": "Goals (20%) and Demo (40%) are individual — your own effort. Reflections (20%) and Check-ins (20%) are group-averaged — your partners' participation matters. This means your group's collective engagement directly impacts 40% of your Sprint 2 grade."

      "explanation": "Sprint 2's demo is 'Demonstration with Validation.' Your growth claims need to be verified by your group partners, not just self-reported. This is the accountability element — external assessment alongside self-assessment."
