Your personal sprint goals.</li><li><strong>Reflections (20%)</strong> — <em>Group-averaged.</em> Everyone in your group contributes; the average score applies to all.</li><li><strong>Check-ins (20%)</strong> — <em>Group-averaged.</em> Outreach, documentation, and engagement activities shared across the group.</li><li><strong>Demo (40%)</strong> — Individual. Your personal demonstration of growth with validation from your group.</li></ul><p>This means <strong>40% of your grade depends on your group's collective engagement</strong>. If your partners don't show up, it affects you. If you don't show up, it affects them.</p><p>Notice how the grading structure mirrors the sprint outcome: the Demo (40%) is where you <em>demonstrate development</em>, and the group-averaged components (40%) are where you <em>document contributions to a peer's growth</em>.</p>",
