        "Memorize your 5 Whys word for word",

      "placeholder": "Example: My skill gap is initiating conversations in professional settings. Through my 5 Whys, I discovered the root cause isn't shyness — it's that I don't know what to say after the opening line, so I avoid starting conversations to avoid the awkward silence that follows...",

        "'I'm bad at public speaking' — because that's what I identified",
        "'I never had good role models for public speaking' — because it explains the history",

      "explanation": "A useful root cause is actionable — it points to a specific behavior or pattern you can change. 'I don't practice in low-stakes settings' is actionable: you can create low-stakes practice opportunities. The others are either too vague, backward-looking, or defeatist."

        "'I tried initiating 3 conversations this week. The first was awkward, the second went better because I prepared an opening question, the third I maintained for 5 minutes' — because it shows specific attempts and progression",
