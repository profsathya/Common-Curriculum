        "Skills that are easy to learn",

      "explanation": "Soft skills are learnable capabilities that affect how you work, communicate, and collaborate. They're called 'soft' not because they're easy, but because they're harder to measure than technical skills."

        "So the professor can judge your weaknesses",
