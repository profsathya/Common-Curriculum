# Design-Level Uncertainty

Core recognition: **We are designing in fog on both the input and output sides.** This isn't a problem to solve — it's a condition to design for.

## Input Uncertainty — What We Don't Know About Students

We don't know whether student struggles are:

- **Intellectual** — don't know what "deeper" means, lack the cognitive repertoire for analytical progression
- **Emotional** — feels risky to go deeper, vulnerability aversion, fear of being wrong
- **Aspirational** — don't see why analytical depth matters for their career, no mental model connecting this work to professional outcomes
- **Cultural** — first-gen students from 60+ institutions have wildly different norms around academic depth, self-assessment, and metacognitive practice

Each of those requires a fundamentally different intervention. Current data shows we can identify surface behaviors but not root causes.

### Student population is not monolithic

Sprint 2 data reveals at least 3 distinct groups:

| Group | Size | Characteristics | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deep analytical thinkers | ~15% | Structural insights, self-correction, cross-assignment connections | CST395: students 03, 06, 15, 20 |
| Working-through-it | ~25% | Engage when scaffolded, struggle independently | Moderate depth, some specifics, don't push past first-level answers |
| Surface compliance | ~60% | Produce format without substance, minimum viable responses | Vague language, no self-correction, checklist mentality |

These aren't a spectrum — they're qualitatively different populations needing different things:

- **Deep students** need challenge and autonomy. More scaffolding would slow them down.
- **Middle group** needs the recognition + moves + persistence intervention (see evidence.md). They have the capacity but lack the technique and the internal standard.
- **Surface group** may need belonging, relevance, or basic academic identity work before analytical depth is even on the table. For 56% first-gen, 45% CC transfer students, "go deeper" may not connect to any lived academic experience.

## Output Uncertainty — What We Don't Know About What Students Need

- "What industry needs" is a moving target — faster than our sprint cycle
- We're designing for jobs that may not exist in their current form
- The honest framing: **pedagogy needs to be robust to uncertainty, not optimized for a specific diagnosis**

We can't design for a single future. We can design for adaptability, analytical capability, and the habit of questioning assumptions — those transfer regardless of what the job market does.

## Implications for Course Design

### Deliberate experimentation, not scattershot

Some amount of trying multiple approaches is needed to cover the landscape. This isn't "all over the place" — it's deliberately experimental with different interventions for different groups.

### Optional work design

Optional/ungraded work has a place — but only if intrinsically interesting. Not "optional reflection" — something like "here's a weird problem I can't figure out, anyone want to take a crack at it?"

For this population (56% first-gen, 45% CC transfer), purely optional work gets **10-15% participation**, exclusively from deep students. Optional work self-selects for the group that least needs it.

### Low-stakes formative diagnostics

Low-stakes formative diagnostics (1 point, completion-based) generate better signal than optional assignments. Students complete them because there's a grade line, but the low stakes reduce performance anxiety and gaming.

### In-class time is the highest-value diagnostic opportunity

- **95%+ participation** — everyone is present
- **Real-time signal** — instructor can observe, adjust, follow up immediately
- **No added out-of-class load** — doesn't compete with other courses for student time
- In-class activities should be designed as diagnostic instruments, not just engagement exercises

### Context files should serve session-level prep

These files should answer "what do I do in Tuesday's class?" not just support design-level analysis. The gap between big-picture insights and actionable session plans is where good intentions die.
