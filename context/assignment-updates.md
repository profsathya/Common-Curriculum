# Assignment Updates

---

## ASSIGN-1: Domain Learning Plan [IMPLEMENTED]

**Problem:** Students treat partner problems as design exercises when they're actually domain problems. If a partner struggles with overeating, the student needs to know what behavioral science says about why food tracking alone usually fails. If procrastination, they need implementation intentions vs. willpower models.

Without domain knowledge, students default to intuition and projection — "what would work for me" rather than "what does the research say works."

**What was built:**
- `cst395/assignments/s2-w7-domain-learning.html` — Written artifact assignment (10 pts, due Sat Feb 28). Three sections: what science says (cite 2+ sources), connection to partner's specific situation, what changes in approach. Replaces earlier Dojo-transcript-based format with a written deliverable.
- `cst395/assignments/domain-research-reference.html` — Interactive reference page covering 4 problem domains (procrastination ~60%, overwhelm ~20%, eating ~10%, exercise ~10%) plus implementation intentions as a cross-cutting concept. Each domain has myth/reality framing, non-obvious insights, reliable sources with links, and investigation questions specific to the partner relationship.
- `config/rubrics/cst395/s2-domain-learning.txt` — Rubric: what science says (4 pts), connection to partner (3 pts), what changes (3 pts). Green/red flag guidance for each section.

**Design decision:** Assignment is highly specific — names the exact domains students are likely working in, provides actual sources rather than telling students to "find sources," and gives concrete weak-vs-strong examples using real problem domains from the class. This follows the emerging principle that specificity drives depth (see Design Principles in course-design.md).

**Status:** Implemented. Sprint 2, Week 7.

## ASSIGN-2: Sprint 2 Demo — Student-Owned Format [PLANNED]

**Format:** Students get complete control over demo format: written, slides, demonstration, interview/podcast style — their choice as long as they fit the timeline.

**Framing:** "Ownership, not freedom." Ownership is harder — you're accountable for making the format work, not just picking the one that's easiest.

### Demo Must Cover 5 Beats

1. **"Here's my partner and the problem I discovered."** — Not what you assumed. What you actually learned.
2. **"Here's what I assumed — and where I was wrong."** — The Week 6 challenge session provides this material directly.
3. **"Here's what I built and the key decisions I made."** — Why this approach and not a different one?
4. **"Here's what changed after the challenge."** — What did you revise, cut, or add based on what your partner told you?
5. **"Here's what would be worse if I'd just handed this to AI."** — What required your judgment, relationship, or understanding that a tool couldn't provide?

### Demo Day Logistics (Week 8, Wed Mar 11)

- Two simultaneous groups of 5 pairs
- ~15 min per pair:
  - 5 min per person presenting
  - 2-3 min questions
  - 1 min partner live validation
- 75 min total presentation time
- Plus 15 min written partner evaluation at end

**Status:** 5 beats defined. Logistics planned. Needs rubric and partner evaluation form.
