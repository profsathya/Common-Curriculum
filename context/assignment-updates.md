# Assignment Updates

---

## ASSIGN-1: Domain Learning Plan [PLANNED]

**Problem:** Students treat partner problems as design exercises when they're actually domain problems. If a partner struggles with overeating, the student needs to know what behavioral science says about why food tracking alone usually fails. If procrastination, they need implementation intentions vs. willpower models.

Without domain knowledge, students default to intuition and projection — "what would work for me" rather than "what does the research say works."

**Plan:** Provide domain-specific scaffolding with:
- Sample sources for common problem domains (time management, procrastination, overwhelm, overeating, motivation)
- "Lessons you wouldn't know" — the non-obvious psychology/science behind each domain
- Framing: "You wouldn't build a medical app without understanding medicine. Why would you build a behavior-change tool without understanding behavior change?"

**Status:** Not yet designed. Target: Sprint 3 preparation materials.

## ASSIGN-2: Sprint 2 Demo — Student-Owned Format [PLANNED]

**Format:** Students get complete control over demo format: written, slides, demonstration, interview/podcast style — their choice as long as they fit the timeline.

**Framing:** "Ownership, not freedom." Ownership is harder — you're accountable for making the format work, not just picking the one that's easiest.

### Demo Must Cover 5 Beats

1. **"Here's my partner and the problem I discovered."** — Not what you assumed. What you actually learned.
2. **"Here's what I assumed — and where I was wrong."** — The Week 6 challenge session provides this material directly.
3. **"Here's what I built and the key decisions I made."** — Why this approach and not a different one?
4. **"Here's what changed after the challenge."** — What did you revise, cut, or add based on what your partner told you?
5. **"Here's what would be worse if I'd just handed this to AI."** — What required your judgment, relationship, or understanding that a tool couldn't provide?

### Demo Day Logistics (Week 8, Wed Mar 11)

- Two simultaneous groups of 5 pairs
- ~15 min per pair:
  - 5 min per person presenting
  - 2-3 min questions
  - 1 min partner live validation
- 75 min total presentation time
- Plus 15 min written partner evaluation at end

**Status:** 5 beats defined. Logistics planned. Needs rubric and partner evaluation form.
