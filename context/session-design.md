# Session Design Principles

Patterns that emerged from Week 6 design and earlier sessions. These are reusable — not specific to one week.

---

## Slide Design Principles

Every in-class session slide deck should follow these structural rules:

### 1. Outcome/Agenda Slide (slide 2, after title)

Every session should have a dedicated slide immediately after the title that concisely presents what students will do in today's session. This sets expectations and gives students a map before they're in the middle of activities.

### 2. One Key Point Per Slide

Each slide should communicate ONE clear point, visible at the top without scrolling. The h2 heading or a prominent takeaway line immediately below it should convey this point. Additional details, examples, and instructions live below and support that one point. If the h2 itself states the key point clearly, no additional line is needed. If the h2 is a topic label (e.g., "Evidence Calibration"), add a distinct key takeaway line that states the actual point.

### 3. Progressive Disclosure for Dense Content

If a slide's content doesn't fit on a single screen and requires scrolling, reorganize it: present a sequence of short supporting points that build toward the key point — all visible without scrolling. Each supporting point should be clickable (using HTML `<details>/<summary>`) to expand into the full detail (quotes, examples, analysis). The expansion may cause scrolling, which is fine — the student chose to go deeper. The default collapsed view should stand on its own as a readable sequence.

## Opening Structure

**Start with universal skill framing before diving into assignment-specific feedback.**

The faculty/sleeping-student example works well as an opener: faculty assume students are who THEY were in college, not understanding that a student falling asleep could be playing video games late — or could be working night shifts to pay bills. If you can't see your assumptions, you can't improve anything. This lands because it's about someone else's blind spot before students have to confront their own.

**Show what worked (strong anonymous examples) BEFORE showing gaps.** Students see quality before they see problems. This sets the target rather than leading with criticism.

---

## Feedback From Submissions Pattern

Use anonymous weak vs. strong examples pulled directly from student work for calibration. Two-column format (weak on left, strong on right) with explicit labels works well in slides.

Students need to see the specific gap between what they did and what quality looks like — not abstract descriptions of quality, but side-by-side comparisons from their own cohort.

### Three patterns worth surfacing in any assumption/analysis work:

1. **Evidence vs. inference** — students say "the evidence is..." then state their interpretation. Show the difference between quoting what was said and adding your story about what it means.
2. **Escape-hatch contingencies** — "I'd change my approach" is not a plan. Name the different artifact, feature, or question you'd pursue.
3. **Projection** — assuming partner's experience matches your own. The students who named their projection are ahead, not because they avoided it, but because they can see it.

---

## Preparation Scaffolding

**Emergency assumption generation (12 min, paper, no AI)** works when many students are underprepared. If 12 of 20 didn't submit the prep work, this recovers the session.

Three prompts per assumption:
1. **The assumption itself** — specific enough to be wrong. "They have bad time management" = too vague. "They delay because the assignment looks simple from the title" = testable.
2. **Evidence vs. your story** — which part did your partner actually say? Which part did you fill in?
3. **What specifically changes if wrong** — not "I'd adjust." Name the different artifact, feature, or question you'd pursue.

**"Specific enough to be wrong"** is the key scaffold instruction. It converts vague observations into testable claims.

---

## Challenge Session Structure

### The Move Set
1. Read assumption out loud — exactly as written, no softening, no qualifiers
2. State evidence basis: "You said [X]. I assumed [Y]."
3. Ask directly: "Am I right, wrong, or is it more complicated?"
4. Write response immediately — on the same paper, right next to the assumption

### Stakeholder Guidance
- If right: say what specifically they understood
- If close: explain what's missing — don't just say "not quite"
- If wrong: say it directly
- If they projected: tell them — "That's your thing, not mine"

### Industry Callback
*"In industry, clients don't tell you you're wrong — they just stop calling. You're giving your partner something more valuable: honest correction."*

This reframe converts "being critical" from rude to generous. Students are more willing to give hard feedback when it's framed as a professional gift.

---

## Reliability Framing

*"Reliability is THE quality the market has always rewarded — and the one AI cannot replace for you."*

Connect to showing up prepared: if 12 of 20 didn't submit the prep work, that's a reliability signal. Frame as professional development, not punishment.

This works because it's true and because it connects course behavior to career outcomes without being preachy. The students who showed up prepared don't need the speech. The ones who didn't need to hear that the pattern is visible and has consequences beyond this class.
