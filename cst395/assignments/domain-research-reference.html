          <h3>What Most People Think</h3>
          <div class="myth-box">
            <p><strong>Common assumption:</strong> Procrastination is a time management problem. If you just had a better schedule or planner, you'd stop procrastinating. Procrastinators are lazy or undisciplined.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
          <h3>What the Science Actually Says</h3>
          <div class="reality-box">
            <p><strong>Key finding:</strong> Procrastination is an <em>emotion regulation</em> problem, not a time management problem. This is the single most important finding in procrastination research over the last 15 years.</p>
          </div>
          <p>When someone procrastinates, they're not failing to manage time — they're avoiding a negative emotion (anxiety, boredom, self-doubt, fear of failure) by choosing something that provides immediate emotional relief. The task feels bad, so the brain prioritizes short-term mood repair over long-term goals.</p>
          <p><strong>Temporal discounting:</strong> The brain devalues rewards and consequences that are far in the future. The reward of completing a project next week feels less motivating than the immediate comfort of watching a video now. Brain imaging shows the prefrontal cortex activates for delayed rewards, but the limbic system dominates for immediate ones. When they compete, the limbic system usually wins.</p>
          <p><strong>The shame-procrastination cycle:</strong> Procrastination → guilt/shame → negative emotion → need for mood repair → more procrastination. Researcher Joseph Ferrari (DePaul University) found that approximately 20% of adults are chronic procrastinators — and for them, shame-based interventions ("just try harder") make the cycle <em>worse</em>, not better.</p>
          <p><strong>Bidirectional feedback loop:</strong> Better emotion regulation reduces procrastination, but increased procrastination also <em>diminishes</em> emotion regulation ability over time. It's a feedback loop, not a one-way cause.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
          <h3>What This Means for Solutions</h3>
          <p>If your partner procrastinates, a planner or schedule alone won't solve it. You need to address what makes <em>starting</em> feel bad. The question to ask: What emotion comes up when you think about starting? Is it the task itself, the fear of doing it wrong, the overwhelm of not knowing where to begin, or something else?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="insight-box">
          <h4>💡 Non-Obvious Insight</h4>
          <p>"Active procrastination" — deliberately working under deadline pressure because you perform better — is a real phenomenon. But research suggests it's actually <em>purposeful delay</em>, not procrastination. The distinction matters: purposeful delay is a strategy; procrastination is avoidance. If your partner says "I work better under pressure," that might be true, or it might be a rationalization. How do you tell the difference? Ask whether they <em>chose</em> the delay or just ended up there.</p>

          <h3>What Most People Think</h3>
          <div class="myth-box">
            <p><strong>Common assumption:</strong> The person needs to learn to say no, prioritize better, or just do less.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
          <h3>What the Science Actually Says</h3>
          <div class="reality-box">
            <p><strong>Key finding:</strong> Overcommitment often isn't a planning failure — it's an <em>identity</em> issue. People who chronically overcommit often derive their self-worth from being needed, busy, or productive.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Telling someone to "do less" threatens their identity. Research on identity-based behavior change shows that change is more sustainable when it <em>aligns</em> with identity ("I protect my energy so I can do my best work") rather than contradicting it ("I should stop helping people").</p>
          <p><strong>Cultural and family dimensions:</strong> For first-generation students, overcommitment may be driven by family obligation, cultural expectations around work ethic, or a felt need to prove the investment in their education was worth it. These aren't irrational — they're deeply held values. A solution that ignores them will be rejected.</p>
          <p><strong>The planning fallacy:</strong> People systematically underestimate how long tasks will take, even when they have direct experience with similar tasks taking longer. This means someone who's overcommitted isn't just bad at saying no — they genuinely believed they had time for everything when they agreed to it. Solutions that address commitment <em>at the moment of agreeing</em> (not after) are more likely to work.</p>
          <p><strong>Decision fatigue:</strong> The more decisions someone makes in a day, the worse their subsequent decisions become. An overcommitted person making hundreds of small priority decisions is depleting their capacity for the important ones. Reducing the <em>number</em> of daily decisions (through routines, pre-commitments, or environmental design) can be more effective than adding more planning tools.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="insight-box">
          <h4>💡 Non-Obvious Insight</h4>
          <p>Many overcommitted people have tried planners and time management tools — and they failed not because the tools were bad, but because the tools addressed <em>scheduling</em> (what to do when) rather than <em>commitment</em> (what to agree to in the first place). The intervention point isn't the calendar — it's the moment someone says "yes" to something new. What's happening in that moment? Social pressure? Fear of letting someone down? Automatic agreement as a habit?</p>

          <h3>What Most People Think</h3>
          <div class="myth-box">
            <p><strong>Common assumption:</strong> It's about willpower. If you just had more discipline, you'd eat less. Tracking calories or using an app should fix it.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
          <h3>What the Science Actually Says</h3>
          <div class="reality-box">
            <p><strong>Key finding:</strong> Willpower is a limited, depletable resource — and emotional eating bypasses it entirely. The brain prioritizes emotional regulation over long-term health goals.</p>
          </div>
          <p>When someone is stressed, the brain releases cortisol, which increases cravings for high-calorie foods. This isn't a choice — it's a neurochemical response. Trying to use willpower to override it is like trying to hold your breath indefinitely.</p>
          <p><strong>Emotional eating is a coping mechanism, not a character flaw.</strong> It provides genuine short-term emotional relief through dopamine release. The brain learns: feel bad → eat → feel better → repeat. Over time, this creates neural pathways that become nearly automatic. The "decision" to eat emotionally happens before conscious awareness kicks in.</p>
          <p><strong>Restriction makes it worse:</strong> This is counterintuitive but well-established. Imposing strict food rules creates a cycle: restriction → deprivation → preoccupation with forbidden foods → emotional trigger → binge → guilt → more restriction. Food tracking apps can <em>trigger</em> this cycle in people prone to emotional eating.</p>
          <p><strong>The real intervention targets are emotional awareness and alternative coping.</strong> Research on mindfulness-based approaches shows that "decentering" — observing the urge to eat without acting on it — is more effective than willpower-based restriction. The key skill is recognizing "I'm experiencing an urge to eat because I'm stressed" rather than "I'm hungry."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="insight-box">
          <h4>💡 Non-Obvious Insight</h4>
          <p>If your partner says they eat "when not hungry" or "to keep their mouth busy" — that's actually a sophisticated self-report. They already know the eating isn't hunger-driven. The question isn't "how do I stop them from eating" — it's "what are they <em>regulating</em> when they eat?" Boredom? Anxiety? The need for stimulation during studying? Each has a different intervention.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 8px;">Also: food is social, cultural, and tied to family identity. "My partner cooks too much and feels guilty wasting it" isn't a willpower problem — it's about values (not wasting food), habits (cooking quantities), and possibly family dynamics. Solutions that <em>respect</em> those values while addressing the behavior are fundamentally different from "eat less."</p>

          <div class="reality-box">
            <p><strong>Key finding:</strong> Habit formation takes 2–5 months, not 21 days. The popular myth has been debunked by a 2024 systematic review. Individual variation ranges from 4 to 335 days.</p>
          </div>
          <p>For exercise specifically, one study found that at least 4 bouts per week for 6 weeks was the minimum to establish an exercise habit. Short-term "30-day challenges" are usually insufficient for lasting change.</p>
          <p><strong>Intrinsic motivation predicts long-term adherence; extrinsic motivation predicts short-term adoption.</strong> People who exercise because they enjoy it or value it personally sustain the habit. People who exercise for external reasons (appearance, guilt, social pressure) start but don't persist. This is one of the most consistent findings in SDT research on exercise.</p>
          <p><strong>Identity beats goals:</strong> Framing exercise in terms of identity ("I am an active person") rather than outcomes ("I want to lose weight") increased habit adherence by 32% in a recent study. When the behavior becomes part of who you are, motivation becomes internal rather than something you have to generate each day.</p>
          <p><strong>Context stability is critical.</strong> Habits form faster in consistent environments — same time, same place, same preceding activity. The advice to "try different workouts to keep it interesting" actually works <em>against</em> habit formation. Variation may prevent boredom, but it undermines automaticity.</p>
          <p><strong>"Motivation" is the wrong frame.</strong> Motivation naturally fluctuates. BJ Fogg's research: designing for low-motivation periods (reducing friction, making the behavior smaller) is more effective than trying to sustain high motivation. Make the behavior so small it requires almost no motivation to start.</p>

          <h4>💡 Non-Obvious Insight</h4>
          <p>If your partner says they "need motivation" to go to the gym — the research says motivation isn't the bottleneck. The bottleneck is usually one of: (1) the behavior is too complex (a full workout routine vs. just showing up), (2) the context isn't stable (no consistent time/place), (3) the activity isn't enjoyable (they're doing exercises they hate because they think they should), or (4) they're framing it as an outcome goal rather than an identity.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 8px;">Calling someone "lazy" because they prefer movies to the gym is interpreting preference as character flaw. They may not have found a form of movement they actually enjoy, or the gym environment itself may be aversive.</p>

    <!-- CROSS-CUTTING: IMPLEMENTATION INTENTIONS -->
    <div class="cross-cutting">
      <h2>Cross-Cutting Concept: Implementation Intentions</h2>
      <p><strong>This applies to ALL of the above domains</strong> and is one of the most well-studied behavior change tools.</p>
      <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>The Core Idea</h3>
        <p>An implementation intention is an if-then plan: "If [situation X] occurs, then I will do [action Y]." Unlike a goal intention ("I want to exercise more"), it specifies the exact when, where, and how. When you form this plan, the situation becomes a trigger that activates the response automatically — like delegating the decision to your environment.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>The Evidence</h3>
        <p>A meta-analysis across 94 studies (8,000+ participants) found a medium-to-large effect (d = 0.65) on goal attainment. This is especially notable because most studies compared implementation intentions against groups that already had goal intentions — the if-then plan provides benefit <em>beyond</em> just wanting to do something.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="insight-box">
        <h4>⚠️ The Limitation Your Partner Needs to Know</h4>
        <p>Implementation intentions work well for <strong>one-time or bounded actions</strong> (getting a flu shot, sending an email, starting a workout). They work <strong>less well for complex, repeated behaviors</strong> that require sustained motivation. A gym study found that simple planning prompts (when/where will you exercise?) had <em>zero effect</em> on exercise frequency over two weeks. The cue loses distinctiveness when it applies to many possible moments.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 8px;"><strong>For your solution:</strong> Implementation intentions can be a component — but they're not sufficient alone for ongoing behavior change. They're most useful for the <em>start</em> of a behavior chain (getting to the gym door, opening the textbook, sitting down at the desk) rather than sustaining the behavior once started.</p>
