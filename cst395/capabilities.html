        CST395 is designed around three core capabilities that together enable you to create value in an AI-augmented world.
        These aren't separate skills—they work together. Every sprint activity develops multiple capabilities,
        with different emphases at different stages of your journey.

        <h3 class="capability-detail__section-title">What It Means</h3>
        <p>
          Self-Directed Learners develop a meta-learning architecture—a systematic approach to acquiring
          expertise in unfamiliar domains rapidly. This capability requires more than desire to learn;
          it's knowing what you need to learn versus what you can strategically ignore, and using AI as
          learning infrastructure to build the required just-in-time depth.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="capability-detail__section">
        <h3 class="capability-detail__section-title">Example in Action</h3>
        <p>
          When a student starts work on building patient communication tools, they need to understand
          medical terminology, HIPAA privacy regulations, clinical workflows, patient psychology under
          stress, and how different age groups interact with technology—in days or weeks, not semesters.

      </div>

      <div class="capability-detail__section">
        <h3 class="capability-detail__section-title">What It Means</h3>
        <p>
          Integrative Solvers apply self-directed learning capacity across domains, developing T-shaped
          (or even m-shaped) expertise—deep knowledge in one technical area combined with broad
          boundary-crossing competencies. In the AI age, the horizontal bar becomes critical: they operate
          at intersections between systems of knowledge where AI struggles but human value concentrates.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="capability-detail__section">
        <h3 class="capability-detail__section-title">Example in Action</h3>
        <p>
          When analyzing customer complaints, an Integrative Solver doesn't just build the requested
          sentiment analysis dashboard. They spend time with the complaint handlers, discovering that
          50 patients generate 60% of complaints—but nobody realized this because complaints were filed
          by date, not patient. They bridge from technical capability to human workflow, delivering
          simple frequency analysis that creates more value than a sophisticated tool.

      <div class="capability-detail__section">
        <h3 class="capability-detail__section-title">What It Means</h3>
        <p>
          Adaptive Builders synthesize self-directed learning and integrative solving to execute, developing
          through cycles of building, testing, learning from failures, and adapting. They exercise restraint
          in complexity, discovering through iteration that simple solutions executed well often deliver more
          value than sophisticated ones.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="capability-detail__section">
        <h3 class="capability-detail__section-title">Example in Action</h3>
        <p>
          An Adaptive Builder starts with basic frequency analysis rather than ambitious sentiment analysis,
          testing whether it solves the core problem. Through iteration, they learn to meet user needs without
          over-engineering. The cycle teaches them to distinguish symptoms from root causes and to iterate
          toward value rather than complexity.

        <h3 class="capability-detail__section-title">The Human Value Question</h3>
        <p>
          Every sprint ends with a Human Value Statement where you articulate what YOU specifically contributed
          that AI couldn't. This isn't about competing with AI—it's about understanding where human judgment,
          taste, and direction are essential. Examples include:
        </p>
        <ul class="capability-detail__list">
          <li>Deciding what problem was worth solving</li>
          <li>Understanding the nuances of stakeholder needs</li>
          <li>Making tradeoffs between competing priorities</li>
          <li>Knowing when "good enough" was actually good enough</li>
          <li>Recognizing when the technical solution missed the human point</li>
