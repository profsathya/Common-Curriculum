        <p>By the end of this meeting, the team should:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Own the direction</strong> — Not just understand it, but take ownership of where we're heading</li>
          <li><strong>Have an action plan</strong> — Concrete next steps with assigned teams and timeline</li>
          <li><strong>Be organized into teams</strong> — 2-3 person overlapping teams ready to execute</li>

        <p>We want the team to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Examine assumptions</strong> — Move beyond their current definitions of their roles</li>
          <li><strong>Relax attachment to current programs</strong> — Accelerate, Launch, Open Source as they exist today</li>
          <li><strong>Recognize AI as a potential fundamental shift</strong> — Not incremental change, but paradigm shift</li>
          <li><strong>Develop their own answers</strong> — Ask questions and work through them, not just receive direction</li>
          <li><strong>Categorize their answers</strong> — Distinguish between "status quo/safe" answers vs. "fundamental shift" answers</li>

        <p><strong>What's been shared:</strong> Strategic Direction artifact (Version 2) covering strategic context, framework, implementation vision, and FAQ.</p>
        <p><strong>Team discussion (1/8):</strong> Initial reactions gathered. Mix of understanding the need to pivot, concerns about implementation, questions about what actually changes.</p>
        <p><strong>Emotional temperature:</strong> Range from worried to cautiously optimistic to inspired-but-challenged. No one is fully comfortable yet — that's expected.</p>

          <p class="section-card__subtitle">Why the meeting is structured this way</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="section-card__content">
        <p><strong>Experience before explanation:</strong> The team needs to <em>experience</em> working with AI at a higher level of abstraction before they can understand the framework we're trying to teach students. The original agenda had abstract discussions; the new design puts hands-on experience first.</p>
        <p><strong>Small group activities:</strong> The entire meeting is designed around paired and small group work. This creates ownership through participation, not just observation.</p>
        <p><strong>Minimal worksheets:</strong> This is a mature team that doesn't need prescriptive guidance. The structure provides scaffolding; the team provides the thinking.</p>
