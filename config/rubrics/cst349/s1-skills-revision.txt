Skills Revision (CST349). Did the student meaningfully revise their skill selection based on Sprint 1 experience? Is there a clear reason for changes (or for keeping the same skill)? Red flag: no revision with no explanation, or surface-level changes. Green flag: honest assessment of why original choice needs adjustment, specific experiences that informed the revision.
