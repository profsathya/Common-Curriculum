Learning Log (CST349). Does the log document specific learning activities and reflections over time? Is there evidence of consistent engagement (not just end-of-sprint catch-up)? Red flag: all entries on the same date, generic descriptions, no reflection on what was learned. Green flag: regular entries showing progression, specific observations about skill development, honest notes about what's working and what isn't.
