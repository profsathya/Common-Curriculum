Sprint 2 Goal Setting for CST349. Quality criteria:
- Are goals specific to their chosen skill (not generic "improve soft skills")?
- Do goals include measurable indicators of growth (how they'll KNOW they improved)?
- Is there a connection between their Sprint 1 self-assessment and Sprint 2 goals?
- Do they reference specific SDL dimensions?
- Red flag: Vague goals ("get better at communication"), no connection to Sprint 1, no measurement criteria.
- Green flag: Goals that reference Sprint 1 baseline data, specific behaviors they want to change, and how they plan to capture evidence.
