Evidence Design for CST349 — students design how they'll prove growth. Quality criteria:
- Is there a clear BASELINE captured (where they are NOW, with evidence)?
- Is the evidence plan specific — what data will they collect, how, and when?
- Does the plan distinguish between self-report and observable evidence?
- Is there a target state — what does "improved" look like in concrete terms?
- Red flag: No baseline. Plan is just "I'll reflect on my progress." Only self-report evidence. Target is vague ("be better at listening").
- Green flag: Specific baseline data point, plan includes external evidence (peer feedback, professional feedback, observable behavior change), concrete target with measurable criteria.
- Critical signal: Does the student actually go beyond introspection to design EXTERNAL validation?
