Networking Event Preparation for CST349. Quality criteria:
- Does the elevator pitch include a specific, honest gap (not a polished strength)?
- Are questions assumption-testing (could produce surprising answers) rather than confirming ("is X important?")?
- Is there a specific evidence gathering plan tied to their Sprint 2 demo?
- Does the follow-up plan include specific actions (not just "send a thank you")?
- Red flag: Generic questions ("what advice do you have?"), polished pitch with no vulnerability, no connection to their evidence design.
- Green flag: Questions that state a specific belief and ask if it's wrong, pitch that honestly describes their growth edge, evidence plan that ties professional feedback to specific demo slides.
