Productive Reflection #3 (CST349). Does the reflection synthesize Sprint 1 learning? Is there evidence of growth across the three reflections? Does it connect to upcoming Sprint 2 work? Red flag: isolated reflection, no growth from earlier reflections. Green flag: references to specific Sprint 1 moments, honest assessment of SDL progress, anticipation of Sprint 2 challenges.
