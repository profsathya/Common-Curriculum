Triad Check-in #1 for CST349. Quality criteria:
- Is the check-in honest about progress (including lack of progress)?
- Does the student report specific actions taken since evidence design (not just plans)?
- Is there reference to group accountability — how the triad helped or didn't?
- Are they using their evidence design plan — or just reporting generically?
- Red flag: Claims of progress with no specific evidence. "Everything is going well" without substance.
- Green flag: Honest assessment (including "I haven't started yet and here's why"), specific evidence of practice attempts, concrete group interactions referenced.
- Critical signal: Is there evidence the student has actually PRACTICED their skill, or just planned to?
