This is the Sprint 1→2 Bridge Reflection for CST349 (Professional Seminar). Quality criteria:
- Does the student identify what they learned about SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING from Sprint 1?
- Do they connect Sprint 1 skill selection to Sprint 2's accountability structure?
- Is there evidence they understand Sprint 2 is about PROVING growth with evidence, not just practicing?
- Do they reference specific SDL dimensions they want to develop?
- Red flag: Generic "I learned a lot" statements. No reference to specific Sprint 1 experiences.
- Green flag: References to specific Sprint 1 assignments, honest assessment of their skill gap, anticipation of how triad accountability will help.
