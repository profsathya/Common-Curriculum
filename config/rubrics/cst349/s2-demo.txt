Demonstration with Evidence for CST349. Quality criteria:
- Does the demo show a clear growth arc from baseline to current state?
- Is evidence concrete and specific (not just "I feel like I improved")?
- Are there external data points (triad feedback, professional input)?
- Does the student articulate what they learned about the LEARNING PROCESS, not just the skill?
- Is there honest acknowledgment of what didn't work or areas still needing growth?
- Red flag: Claims without evidence, only self-report, no reference to external feedback, no metacognition.
- Green flag: Specific before/after evidence, multiple data sources, honest about limitations, demonstrates awareness of their own learning process.
