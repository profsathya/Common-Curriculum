Demo Slide Builder for CST349. Quality criteria:
- Does the 4-slide structure work: Skill + Why (1), Approach + Plan (2), Practice Story (3), Evidence of Growth (4)?
- Is Slide 1 specific about the skill and honest about WHY it matters (not generic)?
- Does Slide 3 include a specific practice story with concrete details (not "I practiced and improved")?
- Does Slide 4 show actual evidence — comparison between baseline and current state?
- Are there external data points (triad feedback, professional feedback) not just self-assessment?
- Red flag: Generic slides, no baseline-to-current comparison, only self-reported evidence, no specific stories.
- Green flag: Specific baseline data referenced, concrete practice moments with honest outcomes, external validation from triads or professionals, visible growth arc across slides.
