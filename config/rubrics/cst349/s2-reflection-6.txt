Productive Reflection #6 for CST349. Quality criteria:
- Does the reflection synthesize across the sprint (not just the most recent assignment)?
- Is there evidence of growth in metacognitive ability compared to earlier reflections?
- Does the student connect networking event insights to their ongoing skill development?
- Is there preparation for the demo — what evidence do they have and what's still needed?
- Red flag: Isolated reflection on one event, no connections across assignments.
- Green flag: Cross-references to earlier Sprint 2 work, honest assessment of overall growth trajectory, specific demo preparation insights.
