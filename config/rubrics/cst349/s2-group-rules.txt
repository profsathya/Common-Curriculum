Group Rules & Check-in Plan for CST349. Quality criteria:
- Are rules specific and actionable (not generic "be respectful")?
- Is there a concrete check-in plan (when, how, what they'll discuss)?
- Do rules address accountability — what happens when someone doesn't follow through?
- Red flag: Copy-paste generic rules, no check-in plan, no accountability mechanism.
- Green flag: Rules that address specific group dynamics, concrete check-in schedule, honest discussion of how they'll handle non-participation.
