This is Prototype v1 + Build Log — the built artifact and documentation of decisions. Quality criteria:
- PROTOTYPE: Is there a tangible artifact (wireframe, script, tool, document, process)?
- PROTOTYPE: Does it address the specific problem identified in the Discovery Doc (not a generic solution)?
- BUILD LOG: Does it document specific decisions and WHY they were made?
- BUILD LOG: Is there evidence of choosing BETWEEN options (not just "I decided to...")?
- BUILD LOG: Does it reference the partner's problem, assumptions, or discovery insights?
- Red flag: Prototype with no build log. Build log that only describes what was built (not why). Solution that doesn't connect to the specific partner problem.
- Green flag: Build log entries that reference discovery insights or assumption audit findings. Evidence of trade-offs. Honest notes about what's uncertain or incomplete. The "why" is as detailed as the "what."
