This is the Sprint 2→3 Bridge Reflection. Quality criteria:
- Does the student identify specific things they learned about working WITH someone else (not just about the problem)?
- Do they articulate what transfers to Sprint 3 (working with an external stakeholder they DON'T know)?
- Is there evidence of growth from Sprint 1 Bridge → Sprint 2 Bridge (more specific, more self-aware)?
- Does the student connect Sprint 2 capabilities to Sprint 3 requirements?
- Red flag: Generic "I learned teamwork" statements. No reference to specific Sprint 2 moments.
- Green flag: Specific partner interactions cited, honest assessment of what was hard about working with someone else, concrete plans for Sprint 3 that build on Sprint 2 lessons.
