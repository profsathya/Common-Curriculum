This is the Sprint 2 Orientation quiz. Quality criteria:
- Did the student engage thoughtfully with orientation questions?
- Do responses show they understand Sprint 2 is fundamentally different from Sprint 1 (working with a partner, building for someone else)?
- Red flag: One-word answers, obvious rushing.
- Green flag: Responses that reference their Sprint 1 experience or express genuine curiosity about working with a partner.
