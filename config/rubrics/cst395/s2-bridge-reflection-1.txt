This is the Sprint 1→2 Bridge Reflection. Quality criteria:
- Does the student identify specific things they LEARNED from Sprint 1 (not just what they did)?
- Do they articulate what they'll do DIFFERENTLY in Sprint 2 based on Sprint 1 experience?
- Is there evidence of metacognition — awareness of their own learning process, not just outcomes?
- Do they connect their Sprint 1 experience to what Sprint 2 requires (working with a partner vs. working alone)?
- Red flag: Generic statements like "I learned a lot" or "I will try harder" with no specifics.
- Green flag: Specific references to Sprint 1 assignments, specific moments of confusion or clarity, and concrete plans for Sprint 2.
