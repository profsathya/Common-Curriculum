This is Goal Setting Part I (pre-partner meeting). Quality criteria:
- Does the student set specific, measurable goals tied to capabilities (SDL/IS/AB)?
- Are goals about LEARNING something, not just completing assignments?
- Do they identify specific capability gaps from Sprint 1 they want to address?
- Red flag: Goals that are just assignment checklists ("complete all work on time") or vague aspirations ("get better at problem solving").
- Green flag: Goals that reference specific Sprint 1 experiences ("In Sprint 1, my 5 Whys stayed surface-level. This sprint I want to go deeper with my partner's problem by...").
