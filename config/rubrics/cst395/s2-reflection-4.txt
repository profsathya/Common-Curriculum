This is Productive Reflection #4 (handwritten, photographed). Quality criteria:
- Does the reflection reference SPECIFIC work done this sprint (not generic course reflections)?
- Is there evidence of metacognition — thinking about their thinking process, not just what happened?
- Does the student connect multiple assignments (e.g., how discovery informed assumptions)?
- Is there honest self-assessment of what's working and what isn't?
- Red flag: Generic reflections that could apply to any course ("I learned to work with others"). Reflections that only describe what happened without analysis.
- Green flag: Specific references to partner conversations, Dojo sessions, or assumption-testing. Honest admission of confusion or difficulty. Evidence that the student sees connections between assignments.
