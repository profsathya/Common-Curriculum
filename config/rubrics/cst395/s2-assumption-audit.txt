This is the Assumption Audit — students categorize their assumptions about their partner's problem. Quality criteria:
- Does the student list specific, testable assumptions (not vague beliefs)?
- Are assumptions categorized with clear reasoning for each category?
- Is there at least one assumption the student thinks might be WRONG?
- Do any assumptions reference specific evidence from the Discovery Doc conversation?
- Does the student distinguish between assumptions based on evidence vs. assumptions based on intuition?
- Red flag: All assumptions feel "safe" — nothing risky, nothing that could change their approach. Or assumptions are so vague they can't be tested ("I assume my partner wants help").
- Green flag: At least one assumption that, if wrong, would fundamentally change the student's approach. Specific evidence cited for each. Honest acknowledgment of uncertainty.
