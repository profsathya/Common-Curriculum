This is Week 6 Preparation (challenge session prep). Quality criteria:
- Does the student list their top 3 assumptions clearly and specifically?
- For each assumption: is there evidence cited from the actual conversation (not interpretation)?
- Is the "Here's What I Think" statement specific enough to be challenged?
- Are the questions genuine — could the answers actually change the student's direction?
- Red flag: Hedged assumptions ("I think maybe..."), questions that can't produce useful information ("Is this right?"), or a statement so vague it can't be challenged.
- Green flag: Direct, testable statements. Questions that would produce different design decisions depending on the answer. Evidence from Discovery Doc cited by name.
