This is Productive Reflection #5 (handwritten, photographed). Quality criteria:
- Does the reflection address where the student's own JUDGMENT mattered this sprint?
- Is there honest assessment of assumptions that were wrong?
- Does it reference specific moments from partner feedback, prototype building, or challenge sessions?
- Is there evidence of metacognition — thinking about their own thinking and decision-making process?
- Red flag: Surface-level "what I learned" without specific instances. No reference to specific Sprint 2 work.
- Green flag: Specific instances where the student's judgment made a difference (or failed). References to specific assignments. Honest confrontation with assumptions that were wrong.
