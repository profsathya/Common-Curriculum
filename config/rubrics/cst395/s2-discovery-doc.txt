This is the Discovery Deep Dive — the core Sprint 2 assignment where students process their partner conversation using the Dojo. Quality criteria:
- Does the student distinguish between what the partner SAID and what the student OBSERVED/INTERPRETED?
- Is there a specific problem identified that goes beneath the surface-level stated problem?
- Does the student include specific quotes or moments from the conversation (not vague summaries)?
- Is there evidence of genuine surprise or discovery — something the student didn't expect?
- Does the student identify what they still DON'T know and need to find out?
- Red flag: A summary of what the partner said without interpretation. No quotes or specific moments. The "problem" is just what the partner stated verbatim.
- Green flag: Clear distinction between stated vs. real problem, specific conversational moments cited, genuine uncertainty about next steps, evidence of using the Dojo to go deeper than their initial impressions.
- Critical signal: Does ANY insight from this document appear to inform later assignments (Assumption Audit, prototype direction)?
