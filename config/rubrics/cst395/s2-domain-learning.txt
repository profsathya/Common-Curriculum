This is the Domain Learning Plan — students research the science behind their partner's problem domain and write what they learned, how it connects to their partner, and what changes in their approach. Quality criteria:

Section 1 — What the science says (4 points):
- Does the student cite at least 2 reliable sources (academic papers, research summaries, expert articles)?
- Did they identify something non-obvious or surprising — a finding that contradicts common assumptions about the problem?
- Is the research specific to the actual problem domain (not generic "behavior change" without domain connection)?
- Red flag: No sources, AI-generated summaries without original research, or "I learned procrastination is bad for performance" (obvious, no depth).
- Green flag: Cites specific researchers/findings, identifies mechanisms (e.g., "procrastination is emotion regulation, not time management"), acknowledges nuance or limitations.

Section 2 — Connection to partner (3 points):
- Does the student reference specific things their partner said in the discovery conversation or assumption audit?
- Is the research translated to the partner's specific situation (not generic)?
- Does the research reframe or deepen understanding of what the partner actually said?
- Red flag: Generic application ("my partner procrastinates so this research applies"), no quotes or specifics from the partner.
- Green flag: "My partner said [X]. The research suggests this is actually [Y], not [Z] like I assumed."

Section 3 — What changes (3 points):
- Does the student name a specific change in their approach, feature, or design choice?
- Is the change clearly caused by the research (not just coincidentally different)?
- Does the student acknowledge what they were going to do before vs. what they'll do now?
- Red flag: "Nothing changes" with no justification, or the solution section is disconnected from the research section.
- Green flag: Clear before/after with specific design implications, acknowledges trade-offs or remaining uncertainty.
