This is the Domain Learning Plan — students identify what they need to learn in the partner's domain. Quality criteria:
- Does the student identify specific knowledge gaps revealed by the discovery conversation?
- Is the learning plan actionable (specific sources, methods, timeline)?
- Does it connect to the solution they're building — learning BECAUSE they need to for the prototype?
- Red flag: Generic learning goals ("learn more about nursing"), no connection to the specific problem, plan is just "Google it."
- Green flag: Specific gaps identified from the conversation ("My partner mentioned X but I don't understand how Y works"), targeted resources, learning tied to prototype decisions.
