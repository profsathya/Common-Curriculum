This is Demo Design — students plan their 4-part demo structure. Quality criteria:
- Does the plan address all 4 demo sections (discovery insight, solution + decisions, iteration from feedback, human value)?
- For each section: is there a specific moment, decision, or piece of evidence planned (not just "I'll talk about...")?
- Does the "human value" section articulate something concrete — what would be WORSE if AI did this alone?
- Is there a clear core message (one thing they want the audience to understand)?
- Red flag: Generic plans ("I'll show my project"), no specific evidence identified, no clear narrative arc.
- Green flag: Specific moments identified for each section, honest acknowledgment of where they're still building, clear articulation of what makes their judgment valuable.
