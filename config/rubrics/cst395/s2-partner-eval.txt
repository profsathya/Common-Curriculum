This is the Partner Evaluation — assessing the working relationship. Quality criteria:
- Is the evaluation specific and evidence-based (not just "they were great")?
- Does it reference specific collaborative moments (conversations, feedback sessions, iterations)?
- Is there honest, constructive feedback (not just praise)?
- Red flag: Generic praise with no specifics. One-line responses.
- Green flag: Specific examples of contributions, honest assessment of challenges, constructive suggestions.
