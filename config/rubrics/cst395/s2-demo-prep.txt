This is Final Prototype + Demo Prep — the polished prototype and demo rehearsal plan. Quality criteria:
- Is the prototype a visible evolution from v1 (evidence of iteration from partner feedback)?
- Does the demo plan follow the 4-part structure from Demo Design?
- Is there evidence that the student has practiced or rehearsed?
- Does the prep identify the core narrative — what's the ONE thing they want the audience to understand?
- Red flag: No visible changes from prototype v1. Demo plan is just a feature walkthrough. No narrative arc.
- Green flag: Clear iteration from feedback, tight narrative structure, evidence the student has thought about what to CUT (not just what to show).
