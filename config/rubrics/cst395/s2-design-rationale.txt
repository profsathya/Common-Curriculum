This is the Design Rationale Log — documenting WHY the solution was designed this way. Quality criteria:
- Does the student explain design decisions with clear reasoning (not just describing what they built)?
- Are there trade-offs documented — what they chose NOT to do and why?
- Does the rationale connect back to discovery insights and partner feedback?
- Is there evidence of iteration — decisions that changed based on new information?
- Red flag: Feature list disguised as rationale. No trade-offs. No connection to partner's problem.
- Green flag: Clear reasoning chains (I learned X → so I chose Y → which meant giving up Z). References to specific partner feedback that changed design decisions. Honest about constraints and compromises.
