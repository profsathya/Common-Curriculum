This is Goal Setting Part II (post-partner meeting). Quality criteria:
- Does the student revise/refine goals based on actually meeting their partner?
- Are there specific references to what they learned about their partner in the discovery session?
- Is there a visible shift from Part I to Part II — did meeting the partner change their approach?
- Do goals connect to what they'll need for the demo ("Here's what I want to be able to show")?
- Red flag: Copy-paste from Part I with no partner-specific adjustments.
- Green flag: Goals that reference specific things the partner said or specific problems that emerged from the conversation.
