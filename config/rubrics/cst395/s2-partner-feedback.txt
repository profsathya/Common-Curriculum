This is Partner Feedback Documentation — recording the partner's reaction to the prototype. Quality criteria:
- Does the student capture their partner's actual reactions (not just "they liked it")?
- Is there a distinction between what the partner said vs. how the student interpreted it?
- Are there specific moments of surprise, confusion, or disagreement documented?
- Does the student identify what they learned that they DIDN'T expect?
- Is there a plan for what to change based on feedback?
- Red flag: Only positive feedback recorded. No specific quotes or moments. No plan for iteration.
- Green flag: Specific partner reactions documented (including negative ones), honest recording of surprises, clear connection between feedback and planned changes.
