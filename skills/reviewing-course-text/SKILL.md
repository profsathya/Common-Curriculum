name: reviewing-course-text
description: Run as the final step whenever student-facing course text is created or substantively edited — activity pages, Canvas assignment/quiz descriptions, self-check JSON blocks (infoBlock, description, prompts), home-page rows and notes, slide body copy, and emails to students. Triggers at the end of any course-development writing task, before the text is saved to a live surface, and whenever a reviewer says content feels long, repetitive, or preachy. Covers mapping the message of each sentence, cutting redundancy within a page and across stacked surfaces, removing sentences with no job, flipping unnecessary negatives, and placing each instruction at the point of action. Developed for Career Intelligence; general across programs.

# Reviewing course text - the checks to run before text goes live

One screen. The rules, the defects they came from and the version history are in `references/rules.md` in this folder - read that once, then run this list as the last step before student-facing text is saved to a live surface. Every line traces to a section there, named in parentheses. `scripts/review_student_page.py` in this folder produces the countable items; it reports and never rewrites. When a rule changes in `references/rules.md`, its test changes here in the same edit (and the other way round).

## Before writing

- The closest existing page of the same kind is chosen, measured, and named in the report. (The structure gate)

## The numbers - reported before the prose pass

- The report shows this page and the comparison page side by side: visible words before the first response field or required action and the screens to it; the longest paragraph and any over roughly 60-70 words; any run of three or more prose paragraphs with no heading, list, table, example or action between. Every gap carries a one-line account. (The structure gate)
- Success criteria sit before the submit control. (The structure gate)
- The report lists passages of 30-40 words repeated across sibling pages in the same week, and every sentence that speculates about someone else's judgment. (The structure gate)
- The report lists every fear, scarcity, shame, survival or deficit frame; where a worry was raised and then reassured, both halves are gone. (The structure gate)
- System prompts, coach notes, button labels and error messages went through the same pass. (The structure gate)
- Every required reflection has somewhere to answer it, or is clearly marked optional. (The structure gate)

## On every sentence

- Each sentence has a one-label message in a written map; a sentence whose message cannot be named is cut. (The discipline, 1)
- No label appears twice across the stack the student reads: home-page row, activity page, engine description, Canvas text, question blocks. (The discipline, 2)
- Deleting the sentence would change what the student understands or does next. Shortening removed whole sentences; no surviving sentence was compressed into a fragment or slogan. (The discipline, 3)
- Warnings, not-X constructions, loss-frames, and exclusivity or survival frames have their positive twin; honesty guardrails stay but do not lead. (The discipline, 4)
- Purpose sections are one or two sentences. (The discipline, 5)
- Each instruction sits where the student acts on it: how to submit in the submit box, hand-write-first on the question that gets hand-written. (The discipline, 6)
- Short blocks (a home-page meta line, a question's sub-note) got the pass too. (When to run)

## On a substantive revision

- Old and new instruction match on who directs whom, who performs the action, and what the action tests. (The test)
- The task, guidance, examples, answer labels, copied question text, checklist and AI feedback instructions all allow confirmed results and justified uncertainty as well as errors or changes. (The test)
- Home-page descriptions pass the complete-instruction test, and openings the connected-explanation test. (The test)

## Before it is saved

- Every word inside quotation marks is the student's, checked against the source; the only alterations are visible [brackets] and ellipses; no gender the submission does not state. (Quoting students)
